# Font Awesome Paid Icons 

This project is a simple HTML page designed to allow users to copy Font Awesome Pro icons quickly and easily. Users can hover over an icon to view the "Copy Code Snippet" tooltip and click to copy the full icon code, which they can paste directly into their HTML files.

## Features
- Hover over an icon to view its name.
- Click on an icon to copy the icon code directly to the clipboard.
- Icons are sourced from Font Awesome Pro, and the repository includes the necessary CSS files for paid icons.
- No need to include the CDN; all required assets are already included in the project.
- Simple and clean layout with hover effects and easy-to-use design.

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Repository
First, download or clone the repository from GitHub:

bash
git clone https://github.com/MHR-RONY/Font-awesome-paid-icon


### Step 2: Extract the Files
Once downloaded, extract the files to your project directory.

### Step 3: Add CSS Files to Your HTML
Include the required Font Awesome Pro CSS files in the `<head>` section of your HTML file. For example:

html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="icon/css/all.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="icon/css/sharp-duotone-solid.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="icon/css/sharp-thin.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="icon/css/sharp-solid.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="icon/css/sharp-regular.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="icon/css/sharp-light.css" />


### Step 4: Choose an Icon
Visit the [Font Awesome Pro website](https://fontawesome.com) and choose the icon you want to use. 

### Step 5: Copy the Icon Code
Once you find the icon, simply click on it, and the icon code will be copied to your clipboard.

### Step 6: Use the Icon in Your HTML
Paste the copied code directly into your HTML file. No need to include the CDN, as the necessary files are already imported through the repository.

For example, to use the **address book** icon, add this code to your HTML:

html
<i class="fas fa-address-book"></i>
